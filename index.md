## Griffin Swank's First CS193 Homework

Hi I'm Griffin, a freshman of Purdue University. I am studying computer science, as I have always been interested in the functioning of computers.

I am beyond excited to be here on campus, and have been loving it, even with everything going on in thw world today. 

I appreciate the commitment to teaching at Purdue University, and the CS193 staff for helping us through challenging parts of our studies!

# Welcome take a seat and let me tell you about some things I admire in CS193.
## I know... Boring Right?
### It will get better, stick with me.

- The group of CS193 professors is a group of young people trying to help us newbies through our programming lives.
- They have been through what we will be through in the upcoming years, so they have learned and can help us to succeed where maybe they could have struggled.

1. Programming isn't always easy, sometimes it can be challenging and frustrating, that is why I admire what this group does for us as new students of the best college in the nation!
2. Boiler Up! Hammer Down!
